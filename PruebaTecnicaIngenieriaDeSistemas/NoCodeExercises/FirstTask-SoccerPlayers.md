# First Exercise
To solve this exercise we first gather the data

* Hugo: $H = 2*Luis$.
* Paco: $P = 3Luis-2$.
* Luis: $L = ? $.
* Total: $T = 58$.

With the above data we can generate the equality:

$$2L + 3L-2 + L = 58$$
$$6L - 2 = 58$$
$$6L = 60$$
$$L = \frac {60}{6}$$
$$L = 10$$

Knowing the goals scored by luis we can know how many goals were scored by pago and hugo.

$$H = 2 \times 10 = 20$$
$$P = 3 \times 10 - 2 = 28$$

We check in the equation:

$$2(10) + 3(10)-2 + (10) = 58$$
$$58= 58$$

It is correct therefore we can say that Hugo scored 10 goals, Paco scored 28 and Luis scored 10.
