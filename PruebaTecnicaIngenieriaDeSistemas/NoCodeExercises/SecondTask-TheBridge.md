# Second Exercise

To solve this exercise, let's first organize the data:

* 1 = 1 minute to cross the bridge.
* 2 = Two minutes to cross the bridge.
* 5 = 5 minutes to cross the bridge.
* 10 = 10 minutes to cross the bridge.

17 minutes = time it will take for the meteorite to fall.

In order for everyone to pass on time, it must be followed that:

* 1 and 2 must first cross the bridge. - 2 minutes until now.
* Then 1 returns with the lantern. - 2 minutes until now.
* The next to cross the bridge will be 5 and 10. - 13 minutes until now.
* 2 returns with the lantern. - 15 minutes until now.
* 1 and 2 cross the bridge - 17 minutes until now 

In this order 1, 2, 5 and 10 will be on the other side of the bridge before the meteorite falls.
