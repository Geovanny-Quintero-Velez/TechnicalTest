## XSD

### Definition

An XML Schema Definition (XSD) is an infrastructure document that defines the rules and constraints for XML documents. An XSD formally describes the elements of an XML document and can be used to validate the content of the XML document to ensure that it conforms to the rules of the XSD. Other sources define it as a language used to define the structure of an XML document.

## WSDL

### Definition

WSDL is an XML notation for describing a web service. A WSDL definition tells a client how to compose a web service request and describes the interface provided by the web service provider.

WSDL defines an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages containing document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. Operations and messages are first described abstractly and then linked to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint. The related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). WSDL is extensible to allow the description of endpoints and their messages, regardless of the message formats or network protocols used to communicate. This means that interfaces are defined abstractly with XML Schema and then linked to concrete representations that are suitable for the protocol.

WSDL allows service providers to specify the following characteristics of a Web service:

* The name of the Web service and addressing information

* The protocol and coding style to be used when accessing the public operations of the Web service

* The type information, such as the operations, parameters and data types that make up the Web service interface
